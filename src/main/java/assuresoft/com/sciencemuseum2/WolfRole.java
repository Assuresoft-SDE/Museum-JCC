 * Enum representing different roles within a wolf pack.

 * alpha: The dominant leader of the pack, responsible for making important decisions, leading the hunt, and protecting the pack.
 * beta: Subordinate to the alpha but still holds some degree of authority over other pack members and often acts as a sub-leader.
 * omega: The lowest-ranking wolf in the hierarchy, often subjected to other pack members and may be excluded from certain social activities.
 * gamma: Less commonly recognized, some observers suggest that gamma wolves are outside the traditional hierarchy but still have influence over the group.
 * delta: Another less common category, delta wolves are proposed to be below betas but above omegas.
 * huntLeader: An individual within the pack who shows outstanding abilities in organizing and leading during hunting activities.
 * caregiver: A wolf that plays a prominent role in caring for the young, helping to protect, feed, and teach the pups.
 * territorialGuardian: A wolf that excels in actively defending the pack's territory against intruders and other wolf packs.
